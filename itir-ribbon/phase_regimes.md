# Phase Regimes (Shared Vocabulary + Lens Packs)

The ribbon supports a shared phase vocabulary across TiRC/SL/SB/LES/DASHI.
These are lens-relative; they describe allocation regimes, not narratives.

## Shared phase tags

- Acquire
- Normalize
- Index
- Interpret
- Contest
- Publish
- Simulate
- Gate

## Lens packs

Lens packs define rho(t) terms for each subsystem. JSON packs live in
`itir-ribbon/lens_packs/` and phase regimes in `itir-ribbon/phase_regimes/`.

## Notes

- Packs are scaffolding; wire them only once signals exist.
- Packs never infer intent or outcome.
