# ITIR Model Ownership

`ITIR-suite` is the orchestration control plane.

The detailed ITIR object model (`Claim`, `Hypothesis`, `Actor`, `Event`,
`Relationship`) is owned by the SensibLaw data-plane docs:
- `SensibLaw/docs/itir_model.md`

For orchestration responsibilities and cross-project routing, see:
