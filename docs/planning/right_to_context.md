# Right to Context (Doctrine)

## Definition

Any person, artifact, or event represented in the system has the right to be
interpreted only within the context in which it occurred.

This is not privacy or secrecy. It is interpretive integrity.

## Distinctions

| Concept              | What it protects            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Right to Privacy     | Non-exposure                |
| FOI / Transparency   | Access                      |
| Right to Context     | Interpretive integrity      |

## Operational Rules

1. No decontextualized judgment
   - The system never renders conclusions without a context envelope.
2. No forced synthesis
   - SB refuses narrative summaries unless explicitly requested.
3. No retrofitted meaning
   - Later facts cannot rewrite earlier epistemic state.
4. Right to expand
   - Any compressed view must be reversible.
5. Right to opacity
   - Users may choose not to interpret.
   - "Unknown" is a valid terminal state.

## Trauma / Legal Proceedings Notes (Target Posture)

The following items are **TARGET** doctrine until enforced end-to-end by
ratified contracts and implementation:

1. Prevent hindsight laundering
   - Preserve "known then" vs "known now" so later facts cannot be used to
     retro-judge earlier actions without acknowledging epistemic limits.
2. Capacity and overload windows
   - Allow envelopes to record overload/fatigue/context-collapse windows as
     constraints, without smuggling interpretive conclusions into canonical
     memory.
3. Venue drift warnings
   - If an artifact moves across venues/audiences (e.g., private therapeutic
     note -> adversarial filing), raise an explicit drift warning and require
     acknowledgement of the venue change before rendering/export.
4. Preserve contradictions
   - Gaps and contradictions remain first-class: the system should not smooth
     them into a "clean" narrative for legibility.

## Why This Matters

This doctrine allows the system to survive:
- Epstein-class scandals
- Cancel-culture dynamics
- Algorithmic outrage economies
- Legal adversarial scrutiny
- Authoritarian misuse

Without becoming:
- a prosecutor
- a rumor mill
- a moral authority
- a propaganda engine

## Front-Page Line

Context is not commentary. Context is infrastructure.
