# Right to Context (Doctrine)

## Definition

Any person, artifact, or event represented in the system has the right to be
interpreted only within the context in which it occurred.

This is not privacy or secrecy. It is interpretive integrity.

## Distinctions

| Concept              | What it protects            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Right to Privacy     | Non-exposure                |
| FOI / Transparency   | Access                      |
| Right to Context     | Interpretive integrity      |

## Operational Rules

1. No decontextualized judgment
   - The system never renders conclusions without a context envelope.
2. No forced synthesis
   - SB refuses narrative summaries unless explicitly requested.
3. No retrofitted meaning
   - Later facts cannot rewrite earlier epistemic state.
4. Right to expand
   - Any compressed view must be reversible.
5. Right to opacity
   - Users may choose not to interpret.
   - "Unknown" is a valid terminal state.

## Why This Matters

This doctrine allows the system to survive:
- Epstein-class scandals
- Cancel-culture dynamics
- Algorithmic outrage economies
- Legal adversarial scrutiny
- Authoritarian misuse

Without becoming:
- a prosecutor
- a rumor mill
- a moral authority
- a propaganda engine

## Front-Page Line

Context is not commentary. Context is infrastructure.
