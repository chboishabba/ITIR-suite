# Casey Git Clone Planning Pack

This pack defines the implementation plan for a standalone superposition-style
versioning prototype based on the Casey thread.

## Files
- `model.md`: core data model and invariants.
- `workflow.md`: operations and expected state transitions.
- `mvp_backlog.md`: prioritized implementation tasks.
- `conversation_step_map.md`: Casey/Muratori thread steps mapped to code/docs.

## Scope
This project lives in its own root folder: `casey-git-clone/`.
