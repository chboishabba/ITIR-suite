## Submodule TODO snapshot
- SensibLaw: S6 in progress with S6.5 external consumer contracts stubbed; near-term focus on schema freezes, sprint selection, Sprint 9 UI hardening, ingestion discipline tasks, and bounded citation-follow expansion; Sprint S7 checklist targets API/CLI projections, golden tests, and red-flag guards.
- SL-reasoner: no TODOs found.
- tircorder-JOBBIE: accessibility TODOs (extend ARIA roles/labels, add `aria-live`, automate audits, expand manual testing).
- WhisperX-WebUI: README TODO list appears complete; translation PRs requested.
- reverse-engineered-chatgpt: README TODOs remaining (better error handling, improve documentation); TODO.md items all completed.
- chat-export-structurer: no TODOs found.
- StatiBaker: pending work across intent/scope, temporal reduction rules (carryover/new/resolved), atom/handle definitions, integration adapters for TIRC/SL/ITIR refs, and guard tests that prevent content summarization.
- notebooklm-py: no TODOs found.
- Chatistics: no TODOs found.
- pyThunderbird: no TODOs found.

## Blockers / constraints
- No explicit blockers listed in submodule TODO files.
- reverse-engineered-chatgpt: send-message testing is stalled due to bot detection (noted in the ITIR-suite README), which may block any tasks that require message sending.
