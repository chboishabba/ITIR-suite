## Last assessed
- 2026-02-08

## Submodule TODO snapshot
- SensibLaw: S6 in progress with S6.5 external consumer contracts stubbed; near-term focus on schema freezes, sprint selection, Sprint 9 UI hardening, ingestion discipline tasks, and bounded citation-follow expansion; Sprint S7 checklist targets API/CLI projections, golden tests, and red-flag guards.
- SL-reasoner: no TODOs found.
- tircorder-JOBBIE: accessibility TODOs (extend ARIA roles/labels, add `aria-live`, automate audits, expand manual testing).
- WhisperX-WebUI: README TODO list appears complete; translation PRs requested.
- reverse-engineered-chatgpt: README TODOs remaining (better error handling, improve documentation); TODO.md items all completed.
- chat-export-structurer: no TODOs found.
- StatiBaker: pending work across intent/scope, temporal reduction rules (carryover/new/resolved), atom/handle definitions, integration adapters for TIRC/SL/ITIR refs, and guard tests that prevent content summarization.
- notebooklm-py: no TODOs found.
- Chatistics: no TODOs found.
- pyThunderbird: no TODOs found.

## Active TODOs
- Current execution pass scope (2026-02-07):
  - Convert live + archived Casey/Muratori conversation steps into explicit
    implementation artifacts for `fuzzymodo/` and `casey-git-clone/`.
  - Implement the mapped steps in code with project-local tests. (Done)
- Term sweep follow-ups from
  `__CONTEXT/last_sync/20260207T043655Z_term_sweep_sl_sensiblaw_itir_suite.md`:
  - Add a repeatable term-sweep runbook doc under `docs/planning/` covering
    scope, whole-word matching rules, and output artifact contract.
  - Add/refresh high-signal thread mappings in `__CONTEXT/convo_ids.md` for the
    top titled `SL`/`sensiblaw`/`itir`/`suite` conversations.
- Add a triage rule for overloaded term `suite` (flag likely false positives
  before context ratification).
- Execute followthrough plan from
  `docs/planning/sb_casey_jesuscrust_followthrough_20260207.md`:
  - implement SB observer/loss schema and refusal-path tests (`1.1`-`1.3`)
  - implement casey operation-contract tests (`2.1`-`2.5`)
  - formalize JesusCrust execution-boundary integration notes and ADR text
    (`3.1`-`3.5`)
- Execute SL engine/profile followthrough from
  `docs/planning/sl_lce_profile_followthrough_20260208.md`:
  - draft domain-neutral engine spec (`docs/planning/compression_engine.md`)
  - define profile contracts (`docs/planning/profile_contracts.md`) for
    `sl_profile`, `sb_profile`, and `infra_profile` boundaries
  - define profile lint rules (`docs/planning/profile_lint_rules.md`) for
    forbidden axes/groups per profile
  - define cross-profile safety tests
    (`docs/planning/cross_profile_safety_tests.md`) that keep compression
    mechanics fixed while admissibility varies
- Apply refreshed SB boundary guidance from
  `docs/planning/sb_casey_jesuscrust_followthrough_20260207.md`:
  - codify "post-mortem forensic analyzers are observers, not memory
    authorities" in SB interop docs/contracts
  - add acceptance checks ensuring forensic imports cannot mutate canonical
    memory without explicit promotion receipts
- Implement Fuzzymodo selector DSL parser over
  `docs/planning/fuzzymodo/selector_dsl.schema.json`.
- Implement canonical serialization + hash generation aligned with
  `docs/planning/fuzzymodo/canonical_hashing.md`.
- Add fixture-driven tests for selector and norm-constraint examples in
  `docs/planning/fuzzymodo/fixtures/`.
- Implement Fuzzymodo exchange channels defined in
  `fuzzymodo/docs/interfaces.md`: selector ingress, norm ingress, facts feed,
  decision egress, and replay artifact emission.
- Implement Casey exchange channels defined in
  `casey-git-clone/docs/interfaces.md`: publish ingress, sync command, collapse
  command, build snapshot egress, and fuzzymodo facts export adapter.
- Implement cross-project channel adapters and validators per
  `docs/planning/project_interfaces.md` for:
  `SensibLaw/`, `SL-reasoner/`, `tircorder-JOBBIE/`, `StatiBaker/`,
  `WhisperX-WebUI/`, `reverse-engineered-chatgpt/`,
  `chat-export-structurer/`, `notebooklm-py/`, `Chatistics/`,
  `pyThunderbird/`, `SimulStreaming/`, `whisper_streaming/`, and
  `itir-ribbon/`.
- Implement ITIR orchestrator control-plane checks from
  `docs/planning/itir_orchestrator.md`:
  context/planning ingress, contract routing validation, execution sync hooks,
  and artifact egress bookkeeping.
- Add an orchestrator manifest mapping producer->consumer exchange channels
  across all component `docs/interfaces.md` contracts.
- Add interface-contract conformance tests that verify required ingress/egress
  payload fields and provenance metadata across component boundaries.
- Re-run docTR timing on SensibLaw root PDFs using `/Whisper-WebUI/venv` (GPU if available) and record results in `doctr/PROFILE_RUNTIME_NOTES.md` on 2026-02-06.
- Implement timeline ribbon UI: conserved-quantity lens selector, conservation badge, lens inspector, segment tooltips, split/merge checks, and compare overlay (see `SensibLaw/docs/timeline_ribbon.md`).
- Wire ribbon UI to selector contract (`itir-ribbon/ui_contract.md`) and expose conservation metadata for Playwright tests.
- Implement SensibLaw lexeme layer tables + ingestion + tests (see `SensibLaw/docs/lexeme_layer.md`).
- Wire TiRCorder WhisperX-WebUI outputs to SB execution envelopes (adapter + tests + fixture). (Done)
- Fix missing TextSpan errors during PDF ingest for `Mabo [No 2]`, `House v The King`, `Native Title (NSW) Act 1994`, and `Plaintiff S157` (or add an explicit allow-missing-spans flag).
- Implement suite-level context safeguards: context-bound artifact view, epistemic state overlay, and context drift warnings (see `docs/user_stories.md`).
- Implement SL claim typing enforcement with inference-to-evidence graph requirements and denial pattern clustering (see `docs/user_stories.md`).
- Implement SB reputational exposure map and power asymmetry indicators (see `docs/user_stories.md`).
- Define Context Envelope JSON schema (see `docs/planning/adr_ctx_001.md`).
- Add UI invariant tests: no context-free rendering, no silent context loss, and
  irreversible compression (see `docs/planning/ui_context_components.md`).
- Wire Context Envelope validation into ingest and render paths (see
  `docs/planning/context_envelope_schema.md`).
- Implement UI invariant test harness entries for context drift, epistemic
  slider integrity, and interpretation-optional mode (see
  `docs/planning/ui_invariant_tests.md`).
- Draft database schema for context envelope storage (see
  `docs/planning/context_envelope_db_sketch.md`).
- Add minimal JSON fixtures for context envelope validation (see
  `docs/planning/context_envelope_fixtures.json`).
- Add UI invariant test runner template (see
  `docs/planning/ui_invariant_test_runner.md`).
- Choose a JSON Schema validator and wire fixture validation into CI (see
  `docs/planning/context_envelope_validate_stub.py`).

## Blockers / constraints
- No explicit blockers listed in submodule TODO files.
- reverse-engineered-chatgpt: send-message testing is stalled due to bot detection (noted in the ITIR-suite README), which may block any tasks that require message sending.
