# Compactified Context (ITIR-suite)

## 2026-02-06
- Documented suite-wide user stories and invariants for context preservation,
  claim typing, and pattern-only exposure across ITIR/SL/SB.
- Added "context is mandatory" invariant and knowledge-state overlay notes to
  `docs/itir_model.md`.
- Updated `TODO.md` with implementation tasks tied to the new user stories.
- Added ADR-CTX-001 and supporting UI and doctrine specs in `docs/planning/`.
